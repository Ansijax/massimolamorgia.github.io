# Course abstract
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to blockchain technologies and
cryptocurrencies, focusing on their foundational principles and practical applications.
The course begins by examining Bitcoin, the first and most popular cryptocurrency,
exploring how it achieves decentralization through cryptographic techniques, proof of work,
and innovative incentive structures. The course then shifts to Ethereum, showcasing its
advancements with proof of stake and smart contracts, which enable revolutionary
applications like tokens and NFTs. Then, the course explores the rising ecosystem of DeFi,
Decentralized services that run on Blockchain and handle over $100 billion, powered
entirely by smart contracts.
However, in the loosely regulated world of cryptocurrencies, where fortunes can be made
overnight, scammers and frauds lurk in the shadows. The course concludes by
showcasing infamous cryptocurrency frauds, such as pump and dumps, rug pulls, and
wash trading.
